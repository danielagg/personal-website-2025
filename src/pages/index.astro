              I advocate for modular monoliths with vertical slicing, Domain
              Driven Design, true CI/CD with Trunk Based Development and feature
              flags, fitness functions, procedural code and compartmentalizing
              volatile parts of our applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about researching adaptable software architectures,
              enabling applications to gracefully evolve over time: I came to
              realize the value of an adaptable architecture, which can
              facilitate the ever-changing landscape of business needs and keep
              the tempo of development rapid, without accumulating technical
              debt.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I love geeking out over architectures, I like to think that
              I'm also pragmatic, always keeping in mind that my goal as a
              software developer is to deliver a working product, not the
              blueprint of it.

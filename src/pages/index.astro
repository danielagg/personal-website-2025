    <h1>Hi there!</h1>

      I specialize in architecting, designing and developing scalable software
      solutions on Microsoft Azure and AWS platforms.
    </p>
    <p class="pt-8 text-base text-accent">
      On the backend, I'm experienced in .NET, Go, Python and SQL. On the
      frontend, I'm experienced in TypeScript, JavaScript (React, Astro, Solid,
      HTMX). Most recently, I've been working on React Native with Expo.

      <p>
        I advocate for modular monoliths with vertical slicing, Domain Driven
        Design, true CI/CD with Trunk Based Development and feature flags,
        fitness functions, procedural code and compartmentalizing volatile parts
        of our applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about researching adaptable software architectures,
        enabling applications to gracefully evolve over time: I came to realize
        the value of an adaptable architecture, which can facilitate the
        ever-changing landscape of business needs and keep the tempo of
        development rapid, without accumulating technical debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I love geeking out over architectures, I like to think that I'm
        also pragmatic, always keeping in mind that my goal as a software
        developer is to deliver a working product, not the blueprint of it.

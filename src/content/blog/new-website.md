title: "New website for 2025"
description: "As 2025 approaches, it was time to slap a new coat of paint on my website. In the process, I also converted into a single Astro codebase the previously separate Astro and Next.js codebases. For the new year, I hope I will be able to post more often."

I use my site to play around with new technologies and ideas. At this point, itâ€™s an Astro site with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. Previous iterations included using NextJS, Svelte and Solid, hosted on Vercel.

title: "Tested domain over TDD"
---

I love unit tests where they make sense (eg. if you are doing DDD, unit testing the core domain is trivial - no need for mocking, and you are covering the moving parts). No matter how you end up with a tested domain, writing tests before or after is just a matter of preference. I don't think TDD is as big of a deal as people make it out to be.

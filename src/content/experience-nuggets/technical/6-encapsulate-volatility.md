title: "Encapsulate volatility"
---

I love Domain Driven Design, but I've been convinced that it's a good idea to encapsulate a unit of code that you know is volatile, even if it spans across contexts. DDD is flexible and modelling is opinion-based - have common sense, and be sensible. Picked up from <a href="https://rightingsoftware.org" target="_blank">Righting Software</a>.

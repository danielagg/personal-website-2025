Almost everyone recommends reading Uncle Bob's Clean Code. However, reputation != dogma. Consume advice critically, be able to disagree and form your own opinions - avoid jumping on a single bandwagon for the whole ride. For Uncle Bob's case, also check out [Casey Muratori interview](https://github.com/unclebob/cmuratori-discussion/blob/main/cleancodeqa.md), debating clean code's concepts. Agree or disagree, do seek different perspectives, recognize that opinions are not facts and everything can and should be challenged from time to time.

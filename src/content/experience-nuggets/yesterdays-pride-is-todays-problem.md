(No idea who said it as in the title, definitely not me, it's too good) We learn and learn - when looking back at code I wrote a year, 2 or 5 ago, its embarassing. We will always notice opportunities, patterns, techniques at hindsight, which our younger selves were ignorant about. This should never change (when it does, it means we've stopped improving).

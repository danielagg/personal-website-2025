title: "Recognize being a victim of your own experience"
---

Each of our experiences is different and unique. Thus, my opinions are different than a FAANG engineer's. The market, the work, and how you get jobs also differ between the US, EU and around the world. A lot of people believe their experience is universal - it's not. Social media connects us, but it's important to understand the differences between our perspectives, mindsets and value systems. When reading other engineer's yappings, it's important to be aware of their context - it may not be the same as yours.

title: "Recognize being a victim of your own experience"

Each of our experiences are different and unique. My experience and thus opinions are different than a FAANG engineer's. Geography also matters - the market, how you get jobs, and so on also differs between the US, EU, India, around the world. Social media connects us, but it's important to recognize the differences between us and our environments, as well as the different mindsets, perspectives and value systems.

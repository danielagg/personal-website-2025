title: "Opinions are not facts, seek different perspectives"
---

Software development is complex and there are many opinions on how to do it. Don't confuse opinions with facts, take everything with a grain of salt, it's not all black and white. Avoid dogmas. Consume advices critically, be able to disagree and form your own opinions (this comes with time and experience, so don't rush it either). Everything can and should be challenged from time to time.

title: "Opinions are not facts, seek different perspectives"
---

Almost everyone recommends reading Uncle Bob's Clean Code. However, reputation != dogma. Consume advice critically, be able to disagree and form your own opinions. This comes with time and experience, so don't rush it either. Eg. <a href="https://github.com/unclebob/cmuratori-discussion/blob/main/cleancodeqa.md" target="_blank">Casey Muratori's interview with Uncle Bob</a>, debating clean code's concepts. Agree or disagree, do seek different perspectives, recognize that opinions are not facts and everything can and should be challenged from time to time.

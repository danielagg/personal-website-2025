Writing the cleanest, smartest, most beautiful software is fun. If no value is being delivered to the business, then it's also a waste of time. Product is king: the goal is to ship software and make our future selves/teammates lives as easy as possible to change what we shipped. This do require knowledge on how to design & architect code, it does not mean to ship sloppy code.

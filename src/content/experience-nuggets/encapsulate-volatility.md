I love Domain Driven Design, but I've been convinced that it's a good idea to encapsulate a unit of code which you know is going to change, even if it spans across contexts. DDD is flexible and modelling is opinion based - have common sense, be sensible. Picked up from [Righting Software](https://rightingsoftware.org)
